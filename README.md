# VPN

I discovered this scripts in Internet (so author is unidentified) and added a few features. It tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 

How to (as root):
1. Execute on the OUTPUT server: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romalukin777/vpn/master/outserver.sh | bash`
2. Execute on the INPUT server: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romalukin777/vpn/master/inserver.sh | bash`
3. Download configs from /root from INPUT server
