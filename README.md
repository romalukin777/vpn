I discovered this scripts in internet (so author is unidentified) and added truecrypt encryption. It tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 

How to (as root):
1. Upload outserver.sh to OUTPUT server
2. Edit IP address in outserver.sh using vi or nano
3. chmod +x outserver.sh && ./outserver.sh
4. Upload inserver.sh to INPUT server
5. Edit IP addresses in inserver.sh using vi or nano
